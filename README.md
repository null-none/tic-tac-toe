# Tic Tac Toe

A simple tic tac toe game build in vanilla javascript, along with some nice HTML & CSS.
There are 2 implementations of this tic tac toe game one is the simple one in which both the user & the bot can win. The other is an implementation where the bot always wins or it ties. But never looses. 


### Javascript Implementation

To use the `simple.js` implementation simply go in the `index.html` file and  at the very bottom in the `script tag` uncomment the line with `smart.js`. If you want to use the the one with the minimax algorithm do the opposite.

```diff
- <script src="smart.js"></script>
+ <script src="simple.js"></script>
```
